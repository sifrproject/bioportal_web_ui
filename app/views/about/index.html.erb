  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Many vocabularies and ontologies are produced to represent and annotate agronomic data. Therefore, there is a need of
    a common platform to identify, host and use them in agro-informatics application. The AgroPortal project aims to offer
    a reference ontology repository for agronomy, reusing the NCBO BioPortal technology. The scientific outcomes and the
    experience of the biomedical domain are thus exploited and transposed in the agronomy domain, including plants, food,
    environment and possibly animal sciences. We offer an ontology portal which features ontology hosting, search, versioning,
    visualization, comment, recommendation, enables semantic annotation, as well as storing and exploiting ontology alignments.
    All of these within a fully semantic web compliant infrastructure. The AgroPortal specifically pays attention to respect the
    requirements of the agronomic community in terms of ontology formats (e.g., SKOS, trait dictionaries) or supported features.
    AgroPortal project is based on five driving agronomic use cases which participate in the design and orientation of the platform.
    AgroPortal already offers a robust and stable reference repository highly valuable for the agronomic domain.

  <p>The AgroPortal is partly achieved within the Semantic Indexing of French biomedical Resources (<a href="www.lirmm.fr/sifr">SIFR</a>) project
    that received funding from the EU H2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie (grant 701771)
    and the French National Research Agency (grant ANR-12-JS02-01001), the NUMEV Labex (grant ANR-10-LABX-20),
    the Computational Biology Institute of Montpellier (grant ANR-11-BINF-0002) as well as by University of Montpellier and the CNRS.
    We also thank the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies for help and time spent with us in deploying the AgroPortal.</p>
